# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# IMPORTANT: As of Alacritty 0.13.0, the configuration format has
# shifted from YAML to TOML. If you're on a newer version, you should
# use `alacritty.toml` and convert this configuration using `alacritty migrate`.

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  TERM: xterm-256color

window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)
  #
  # Number of lines/columns (not pixels) in the terminal. The number of columns
  # must be at least `2`, while using a value of `0` for columns and lines will
  # fall back to the window manager's recommended size.
  dimensions:
    columns: 133
    lines: 40

  # Window position (changes require restart)
  #
  # Specified in number of pixels.
  # If the position is not set, the window manager will handle the placement.
  #position:
  #  x: 0
  #  y: 0

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  padding:
    x: 10
    y: 10

  # Window decorations (changes require restart)
  #
  # Values for `decorations`:
  # - full:
  # - none:
  # - transparent:
  # - buttonless:
  decorations: full

  # Opacity
  #
  # Window opacity as a floating point number from `0.0` to `1.0`.
  # The value `0.0` is completely transparent and `1.0` is opaque.
  #
  # Note: This is an older option, newer Alacritty versions might prefer `background_opacity` under `colors`.
  opacity: 0.8

  # Dynamic title
  #
  # Set `true` to have Alacritty automatically change the window title to
  # reflect the current foreground process.
  dynamic_title: true

  # Window class (Linux/BSD only):
  #class:
  #  # Application instance name
  #  instance: Alacritty
  #  # General application class
  #  general: Alacritty

  # GTK theme variant (Linux/BSD only)
  #
  # Override the variant of the GTK theme. Commonly supported values are `dark`
  # and `light`. Set this to `None` to use the default theme variant.

# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the

  # - { key: C, mods: Control, action: Copy }
  # - { key: V, mods: Control, action: Paste }
  # To re-enable Ctrl+C for interrupt (SIGINT) with the above, you'd

# Shell
#
# You can override the default shell with a custom command.
# This is useful if you want to use a different shell or pass arguments to it.
#shell:
#  program: /usr/bin/zsh
#  args:
#    - --login

# Hints (Clickable URLs/paths)
#
# Hints allow Alacritty to recognize text patterns (like URLs, file paths)
# and make them clickable or actionable.
# For example, Ctrl+Shift+O (default) to open URLs.
#
# If you want to customize hints for specific patterns (e.g., file:line:col):
#hints:
#  enabled:
#    - regex: "(ipfs|ipns|ssb|dat|dweb|ethereum|solana|bitcoin):[a-zA-Z0-9]+"
#      hyperlinks: true
#      command: { program: "xdg-open", args: ["{text}"] } # Linux example

# Debugging options
#debug:
#  render_timer: false
#  persistent_logging: false
#  log_level: Warn # Possible values: Trace, Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Off
